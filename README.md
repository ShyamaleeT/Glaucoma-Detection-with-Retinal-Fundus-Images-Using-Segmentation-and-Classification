# Glaucoma-Detection-with-Retinal-Fundus-Images-Using-Segmentation-and-Classification

We've implemented two methods. The first one is CNN Based Fundus Images Classification For Glaucoma Identification  and the second one is Attention U-Net for 
Glaucoma Identification Using Fundus Image Segmentation

1. CNN Based Fundus Images Classification For Glaucoma Identification - 
This study uses three different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures, namely Inception-v3, Visual Geometry Group 19 (VGG19), Residual Neural Network 50 (ResNet50), to classify glaucoma subjects using eye fundus images. In addition, several data pre-processing and augmentation techniques were used to
avoid overfitting and achieve high accuracy. The aim of thispaper is to comparative analysis of the performance obtainedfrom different configurations with CNN architectures and hyperparameter tuning.

2. Attention U-Net for Glaucoma Identification Using Fundus Image Segmentation - 
This study proposes attention UNet models with three Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures, namely Inception-v3, Visual Geometry Group 19 (VGG19), Residual Neural Network 50 (ResNet50) to segment fundus images.

Datasets

We've used two dataset and spliit the datasets into 70:15:15 (train, test and validation) ratio.

After spliit the dataset

--> RIM-ONE dataset

      Train set - 4512 images (Glaucoma:2232 images, Normal: 2280 images)
      
      Test set - 976 images (Glaucoma:480 images, Normal:496 images)
      
      Validation set - 970 images (Glaucoma:480 images, Normal:490 images)
